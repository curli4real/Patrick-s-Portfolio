    <h1>About Me</h1>
    <p>Hi! I'm Patrick Barnaja, a passionate Web Developer and Graphic Designer. I graduated from Global Reciprocal College with a Bachelor's degree in Information Technology. My journey started with curiosity about how websites worked, and now I’m crafting full experiences with code and creativity.</p>
    <p>I love turning ideas into beautiful, interactive designs — whether it’s developing responsive websites or designing eye-catching visuals. Outside of tech, I’m inspired by art, culture, and the vibe of purple — just like the lean in a cup, real chill and bold.</p>
